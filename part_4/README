token_type = ['string', 'atomwise', 'kmer', 'SPE', 'AIS']

1. Convert SMILES to tokens using each method
 ['atomwise', 'kmer', 'SPE', 'AIS']

2. Define a decoder for each token

3. Perform the SMILES -> TOKEN -> SMILES process using the defined encoder and decoder and check if the initial SMILES is recovered by drawing the molecular structure using MolToImage.

4. ['string', 'atomwise'] Compare the differences between the two methods and check what differences occur after tokenization.

5. Create a vocabulary of tokens in each tokenization method and check the tokens that appear at the maximum and minimum for each method.

6. Plot the frequency of token types in each tokenization method with a plt.
	Frequencies below 10 are ignored
